        "Broadcasting in NumPy is a powerful feature that allows for operations between arrays of different shapes and sizes without explicitly creating additional copies of the data. It enables NumPy to work efficiently with arrays of different shapes during arithmetic operations.\n",
        "The basic idea behind broadcasting is to perform element-wise operations on arrays of different shapes by implicitly expanding or duplicating the smaller array to match the shape of the larger one. NumPy achieves this without actually creating multiple copies of the data, making it memory-efficient.\n",

        "Here are the key rules for broadcasting in NumPy:\n",

        "2.Size Compatibility: For dimensions that are 1 in one of the arrays, the array is implicitly stretched to match the size of the corresponding dimension in the other array.\n",
