        "Standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values. It provides insight into how spread out the values in a data set are relative to the mean (average). A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean, while a high standard deviation suggests greater variability.\n",

        "Hypothesis testing in statistics serves the purpose of making inferences and decisions about a population based on a sample of data. Here are the key purposes:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Testing Research Hypotheses: Hypothesis testing is used to assess whether there is enough evidence in a sample to support or reject a specific hypothesis about a population parameter. Researchers formulate a null hypothesis (often denoted as H0) and an alternative hypothesis (H1), then analyze sample data to make conclusions.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Decision-Making: Hypothesis testing provides a structured framework for decision-making. By comparing sample data to a hypothesized population parameter, statisticians can make informed decisions about whether to accept or reject the null hypothesis.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Inference about Population: Based on sample data, hypothesis testing allows researchers to make inferences about the population from which the sample was drawn. This is crucial when it is impractical or impossible to study an entire population.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Control of Type I and Type II Errors: Hypothesis testing helps control errors in decision-making. Type I error occurs when the null hypothesis is incorrectly rejected, and Type II error occurs when the null hypothesis is incorrectly accepted. The significance level (alpha) and power of the test are set to control these errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Scientific Validity: In scientific research, hypothesis testing is a fundamental tool for establishing the validity of research findings. It allows researchers to draw conclusions about the population based on observed sample data and provides a measure of uncertainty in those conclusions.\n",

        "6. Comparison of Groups: Hypothesis testing is commonly used to compare groups and assess whether observed differences are statistically significant. This is essential in various fields, such as medicine, social sciences, and business.\n",

This doesn't mean that buying more ice cream causes more drownings or vice versa. Instead, both variables are influenced by a third variable: temperature. Warmer weather increases both ice cream sales and the number of people going to the beach, leading to a correlation between ice cream sales and drownings. The correlation does not imply causation.\n",

This is an example of establishing causation through experimental design.\n"

        "3.Mathematical Formulation: If (X) is a random variable with mean and standard deviation, then the distribution of the sample mean for a sample of size  will have a mean and a standard deviation.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.Implications: The Central Limit Theorem is powerful because it allows statisticians to make inferences about population parameters based on sample means.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.Sampling Distribution of the Sample Mean: The sampling distribution of the sample mean becomes narrower and more symmetrical as the sample size increases.\n",

        "6.Practical Use: The Central Limit Theorem is often applied when dealing with inferential statistics. For example, it justifies using normal distribution-based statistical tests (like the z-test) even when the population distribution is unknown or not normal, as long as the sample size is sufficiently large.\n",
        "\n",
